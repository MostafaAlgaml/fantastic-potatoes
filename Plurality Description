 üó≥Ô∏è Plurality 

## Description
This program implements a simple *plurality voting system, where the candidate with the **most votes wins*.

The program:
- Accepts candidate names via command-line arguments
- Prompts the user for the number of voters
- Collects each voter's choice
- Validates the vote and updates totals
- Prints the name(s) of the winning candidate(s)

If two or more candidates receive the same highest number of votes, *all are declared winners* (tie-handling included).

$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 3
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Alice
Alice
