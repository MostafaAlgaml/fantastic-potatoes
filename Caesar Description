# 🔐 Caesar – CS50 Week 2

## Description
This program implements the *Caesar cipher*, a simple encryption algorithm that shifts each letter in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

The program:
- Accepts a *numeric key* as a command-line argument
- Prompts the user for *plaintext*
- Outputs the *ciphertext*, where each letter is shifted by the given key
- Preserves letter *casing* and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged

---

## Example Usage

```bash
$ ./caesar 3
plaintext:  Hello, World!
ciphertext: Khoor, Zruog!
