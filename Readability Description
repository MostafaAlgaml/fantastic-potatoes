# ðŸ“š Readability 

## Description
This program calculates the *reading grade level* of a piece of text using the *Coleman-Liau index* â€” a formula used to estimate the U.S. school grade required to understand the text.

The program:
- Prompts the user for a block of *text*
- Counts the number of *letters, **words, and **sentences*
- Applies the Coleman-Liau formula:
- L = average number of letters per 100 words  
- S = average number of sentences per 100 words

- Prints the *grade level*:
- "Grade X" if between 1â€“16
- "Before Grade 1" if below 1
- "Grade 16+" if above 16
