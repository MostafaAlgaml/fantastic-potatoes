üó≥Ô∏è Runoff ‚Äì CS50 Week 3

## Description
This program simulates a *runoff election* using the *instant-runoff voting* system.  
Each voter ranks candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a majority in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and votes are redistributed according to the next preference. This process continues until a candidate wins by majority or a tie occurs.

The program:
- Accepts candidate names as *command-line arguments*
- Prompts each voter to *rank candidates*
- Eliminates the candidate(s) with the fewest votes in each round
- Continues until one candidate has *more than 50%* of the votes, or a tie occurs
