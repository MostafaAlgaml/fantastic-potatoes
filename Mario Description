# ðŸ§± Mario â€“ CS50 Week 1

## Description
This program recreates the iconic *Super Mario-style pyramid* using hashes (#) and user input.  
It asks the user to enter a height (1â€“8), and then prints either:

- A *right-aligned half-pyramid* (Mario Less)
- Or a *full pyramid with a gap in the middle* (Mario More)

Both are built using *nested loops* and *basic control structures* in C.
